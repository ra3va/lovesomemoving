# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Next.js 15.3.4** project for "Lovesome Moving Services" - a moving company website built with:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **TailwindCSS 4** for styling (with PostCSS)
- **App Router** architecture (src/app directory)
- **ESLint** for code linting

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev              # Starts Next.js dev server on localhost:3000

# Build and deployment  
npm run build           # Creates production build
npm run start           # Starts production server

# Code quality
npm run lint            # Runs ESLint to check code quality
```

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - `layout.tsx` - Root layout with Geist fonts and global styles
  - `page.tsx` - Homepage with moving company content
  - `globals.css` - Global CSS styles
- `public/` - Static assets
- Configuration files in root (next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### Key Features
- **Single-page marketing site** for moving services
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Contact forms** for quote requests (not yet functional)
- **Custom color scheme**: Primary purple (#B85A9B), secondary (#7A4B6B), accent pink (#E91E63)
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### Styling Approach
- Uses **inline styles** for brand colors instead of CSS custom properties
- **TailwindCSS classes** for layout, spacing, and common utilities
- **Custom styled components** with style props for brand-specific colors

### Accessibility Guidelines
- **NEVER use grey text on white backgrounds** - always use high contrast text colors
- Use `text-gray-900` (dark) or `text-gray-800` (medium dark) for main text on white backgrounds
- Use `font-bold` or `font-semibold` to ensure text is easily readable
- Brand theme: "Moved with Love" - focus on care, family, and emotional connection
- Avoid using personal names in copy - keep messaging company-focused

### Image Generation
- **Always use model**: `fal-ai/imagen4/preview/fast` for image generation
- **Hero images**: Use `"aspect_ratio": "16:9"` for proper website hero sections
- **Available aspect ratios**: 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 3:4, 4:3
- **Composition**: Ensure full faces/bodies visible, no cropped faces
- Generate images that align with "moved with love" theme

## Important Notes

- The project uses **src/ directory structure** (not root app/ directory)
- Forms are currently **static HTML** - no backend integration yet
- **Image import** is unused in page.tsx (TypeScript warning exists)
- Uses **Next.js font optimization** with Geist font family
- Brand messaging centers around love, care, and family values

Always check if the npm development server is running before starting a new one in any folder; if a server is already running and you need to start a new one, kill the existing instance first using Ctrl+C or by finding and killing the process.

## Session Logging Protocol

**When user says "end this session" or similar, Claude must immediately log the session.**

### Session Logging Steps
1. **Get Timestamp**: Run `date` command to get current timestamp
2. **Create Sessions Directory**: Ensure `/Users/rathriva/Documents/lovesomemoving/sessions` exists
3. **Create Session Log**: Write comprehensive session summary to new file

### Session File Naming Convention
```
/Users/rathriva/Documents/lovesomemoving/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic-description.md
```

### Session Log Structure
```markdown
# [Session Topic] Session
**Date**: [Full timestamp from date command]
**Duration**: [Estimated session length]
**Focus**: [Primary objective/topic]

## Session Summary
### Primary Objectives Completed âœ…
[List major accomplishments]

## Key Issues Resolved
[Technical problems solved]

## Technical Implementation
[Code changes, architecture decisions]

## Files Modified/Created
### Committed to Production
[Files pushed to GitHub/production]

### Local Development Only
[Local-only files for security]

## Testing Results
[Verification of functionality]

## Business Impact
[Effect on project goals]

## Technical Capabilities Unlocked
[New features/capabilities enabled]

## Next Steps & Recommendations
[Future actions and suggestions]

## Session Outcome
[Final status and results]

---
*End of Session: [timestamp]*
```

### Session Logging Triggers
- User explicitly says: "end this session", "end session", "log this session"
- User asks to "wrap up", "finish up", or "close out"
- User says "goodbye", "done for now", or similar session-ending phrases

### Critical Session Logging Requirements
- **ALWAYS get fresh timestamp** with `date` command
- **Create sessions directory** if it doesn't exist
- **Document all major changes** especially code modifications
- **Note security implications** (what's committed vs local)
- **Include business context** and impact
- **List next steps** for continuity
- **Use descriptive filename** that captures session essence
