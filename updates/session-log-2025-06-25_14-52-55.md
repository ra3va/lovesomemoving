# Session Update Log: 2025-06-25_14-52-55

This document summarizes the changes made during our pair programming session.

## Session Goals:
- Redesign the website's hero section and header.
- Improve UI, typography, and mobile responsiveness.
- Integrate dynamic Google reviews.
- Add thematic animations and visual elements.

## Changes Implemented:

1.  **Header Redesign:**
    *   Updated the header with a new color scheme (`#8C4381`).
    *   Replaced the original logo and navigation with a new layout featuring a centered phone number and streamlined navigation links.

2.  **Hero Section Overhaul:**
    *   Replaced the original two-column layout with a single-column design, then reverted to an improved two-column layout based on feedback.
    *   Adjusted the background image (`hero.png`) to be more visible, first with `object-left` and then `object-center` positioning.
    *   Corrected the headline from "Family Moving, Family Care" to "Family Moving Family."
    *   Introduced the 'Poppins' font for a more modern and professional feel.

3.  **Enhanced Social Proof:**
    *   Replaced the static star rating with a dynamic line featuring the Google logo, "132+ Perfect 5-Star reviews on Google," and five star icons for stronger social validation.

4.  **Visual and Thematic Improvements:**
    *   Added a custom wavy SVG border to the bottom of the hero section for a unique design touch.
    *   Implemented a `FloatingHearts` component to add a subtle, on-theme animation to the hero section, with hearts of varying sizes.
    *   Added a themed border to the team photo and zoomed in on the subjects to make them more prominent.

5.  **Google Reviews Integration:**
    *   Restructured the testimonials section to accommodate a live Google Reviews widget.
    *   Embedded a third-party widget from Elfsight to display real-time reviews.
    *   Removed the now-redundant static reviews for a cleaner look.

6.  **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   Reordered the hero section elements to display the logo at the top on mobile devices.
    *   Tightened spacing between elements in the hero section to improve the mobile layout and create a more compact, polished appearance.

This session successfully transformed the website's initial section into a more visually appealing, trustworthy, and on-brand experience.
