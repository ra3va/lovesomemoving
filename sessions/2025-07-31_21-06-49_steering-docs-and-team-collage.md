# Steering Documents and Team Collage Session
**Date**: Thu Jul 31 21:06:49 CDT 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: Creating Kiro steering documents and enhancing homepage team section

## Session Summary
### Primary Objectives Completed ✅
- Created comprehensive Kiro steering documents for AI development guidance
- Enhanced homepage with artistic team photo collage layout
- Added new teamshot.jpg image to showcase more team members
- Implemented overlapping photo design with brand-consistent styling
- Successfully committed and pushed all changes to repository

## Key Issues Resolved
- Repository lacked AI development guidance documentation
- Team section only showed single image, limiting team visibility
- Needed better visual presentation of team photos
- Required consistent brand color application across new elements

## Technical Implementation
- **Steering Documents**: Created 4 markdown files in `.kiro/steering/` directory
  - `product.md`: Business overview, brand colors, contact info
  - `tech.md`: Technology stack, development commands, build configuration
  - `structure.md`: Project organization, naming conventions, architecture patterns
  - `session-logging.md`: Protocol for proper session documentation
- **Team Collage**: Replaced simple grid with artistic overlapping layout
  - Implemented CSS transforms with subtle rotations (-2° and +3°)
  - Added z-index layering for proper visual hierarchy
  - Included decorative heart accent for brand consistency
  - Maintained responsive design across all screen sizes

## Files Modified/Created
### Committed to Production
- `.kiro/steering/product.md` - Product and brand documentation
- `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Technical stack and development guide
- `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Project architecture documentation
- `.kiro/steering/session-logging.md` - Session logging protocol
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Enhanced team section with collage layout
- `public/teamshot.jpg` - New team photo asset

### Local Development Only

## Next Steps & Recommendations

3. **Mobile Optimization**: Test collage layout on various mobile devices
4. **SEO**: Add more descriptive alt text for team images
5. **Performance**: Optimize image sizes for faster loading
